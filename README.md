Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

There some methods of Machine Learning.
  1)Supervised Learning
      a)KNN
      b)Logistic Regression
      c)Linear Regression
      d)SVM (Support Vector Machine)
      e)Naive Bayes
      f)Decision Tree
      g)Random Forest
  2)Unsupervised Learning
      a)k-means
      b)Hierarchical clustering
  3)Reinforcement
