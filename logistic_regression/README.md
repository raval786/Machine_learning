<h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
Logistic regression is another technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics

<h2>Logistic Functoin</h2>
Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method, the logistic function.
<br>
The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function was developed by statisticians to describe properties of population growth in ecology, rising quickly and maxing out at the carrying capacity of the environment. It’s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.

1 / (1 + e^-value)

Where e is the base of the natural logarithms (Euler’s number or the EXP() function in your spreadsheet) and value is the actual numerical value that you want to transform. Below is a plot of the numbers between -5 and 5 transformed into the range 0 and 1 using the logistic function.
